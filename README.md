 This project was generated with Angular CLI version 7.3.0.

This is a fork of ng-tagcanvas by LucHariman. 

Repo includes the library as well as an example app. Run ng serve in src and ng build --watch in projects folder to enable dynamic reloading of both library and app.

Refer to docs at http://www.goat1000.com/tagcanvas-options.php

Main difference to ng-tagcanvas 0.0.1 is the ability to add images on top of text. This is exactly what i needed and as such will probaby be the last i edit this library. Feel free to contribue. Available on npm at https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloudee.
